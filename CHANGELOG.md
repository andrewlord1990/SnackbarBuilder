# Changelog

## v0.5.0 (06/03/16)

### Features

- Append messages to the end of the main `Snackbar` messages. Each of these appended messages can have a different colour specified.
- Add an icon to the `Snackbar`.
- Added a `SnackbarWrapper`, to allow you to customise the `Snackbar` after it has been created.

### API Changes

- Builder methods which take a `String` now take a `CharSequence`, so will honour any spans that have been applied already.
- Rather than providing styling through single theme attributes, you assign a whole style to the theme attributes `snackbarBuilderStyle` and `toastBuilderStyle`. This cleans up your theme and is a bit easier as you can extend the built-in `SnackbarBuilder` style.
- Moved the `ToastBuilder` to be within the `snackbarbuilder` package, to ensure the whole library is within a single base package.

### Improvements
- Added JavaDoc comments to the full public API.
