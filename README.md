The Android Design Support library introduced a Snackbar class. SnackbarBuilder is a builder pattern that makes Snackbars easier to make and customise.

The `Snackbar` has a dark background, but takes the default text color from your theme, which is often dark. This often makes the messages hard to read and requires you retrieve the TextView and change the text color. `SnackbarBuilder` defaults the text color to white and then allows you to choose your own colour if you wish.



## Download

Download via Gradle:
```groovy
compile 'com.github.andrewlord1990:snackbarbuilder:0.3'
```
or Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.andrewlord1990</groupId>
  <artifactId>snackbarbuilder</artifactId>
  <version>0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

The library is available on Bintray (JCenter) and Maven Central.


## Main Features

- Builder pattern to create Snackbars
- Customise message and action text color with global theme attributes and on a per-Snackbar basis
- Dismiss callbacks with separate methods for each type of dismiss event
- Theme attribute for default view ID in activity to attach Snackbars to, so you don't need to provide parent view each time you wish to show one
- Set default duration to use through a theme attribute

## Usage

### Create

Build the Snackbar, making it very easy to build and customise the snackbar.

```java
Snackbar snackbar = new SnackbarBuilder(this)
              .message("message")
              .actionText("Action")
              .snackbarCallback(new MySnackbarCallback())
              .build()
              .show();
```

Check out the sample project to see examples of how the library can be used.

### Callback

Extend the `SnackbarCallback` class and override only the methods you are interested in. Rather than needing to check the `dismissEvent` integer in the `Snackbar.Callback` class, there is a separate method to override for each dismiss type.

```java
private class MySnackbarCallback extends SnackbarCallback {

    public void onSnackbarShown(Snackbar snackbar) {
        // Snackbar shown
    }

    public void onSnackbarActionPressed(Snackbar snackbar) {
        // Snackbar action button pressed
    }

    public void onSnackbarSwiped(Snackbar snackbar) {
        // Snackbar dismissed via swipe
    }

    public void onSnackbarTimedOut(Snackbar snackbar) {
        // Snackbar dismissed via timeout (after duration passed)
    }

    public void onSnackbarManuallyDismissed(Snackbar snackbar) {
        // Snackbar dimissed via call to dismiss()
    }

    public void onSnackbarDismissedAfterAnotherShown(Snackbar snackbar) {
        // Snackbar dismissed because another Snackbar shown
    }
}
```
