The Android Design Support library introduced the `Snackbar`. SnackbarBuilder provides a builder pattern that not only makes Snackbars easier to create, but it also provides some extra customisations.

One of the main annoyances with the `Snackbar` is that it has a dark background, but takes the default text color from your theme, which is often dark as well. This makes the messages hard to read and requires you to retrieve the `TextView` yourself and change the text color. `SnackbarBuilder` defaults the text color to white and then allows you to choose your own colour if you wish.


## Download

Download via Gradle:
```groovy
compile 'com.github.andrewlord1990:snackbarbuilder:0.4'
```
or Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.andrewlord1990</groupId>
  <artifactId>snackbarbuilder</artifactId>
  <version>0.4</version>
</dependency>
```

The library is available on Bintray (JCenter) and Maven Central.


## Main Features

- A builder pattern to create Snackbars.
- Customise message and action text color with global theme attributes and on a per-Snackbar basis.
- Dismiss callbacks with separate methods for each type of dismiss event.
- Theme attribute for the default view ID in an activity to attach Snackbars to, so you don't need to provide the parent view each time you wish to show one.
- Set the default duration to use through a theme attribute.
- A ToastBuilder to create Toast messages, with a builder pattern and global theme attributes.

## Usage

### Create

It is really easy to build and customise snackbars.

```java
Snackbar snackbar = new SnackbarBuilder(this)
              .message("message")
              .actionText("Action")
              .snackbarCallback(new MySnackbarCallback())
              .build()
              .show();
```

Check out the sample project to see examples of how the library can be used.

### Callback

Extend the `SnackbarCallback` class and override only the methods you are interested in. Rather than needing to check the `dismissEvent` integer in the `Snackbar.Callback` class, there is a separate method to override for each dismiss type.

```java
private class MySnackbarCallback extends SnackbarCallback {

    public void onSnackbarShown(Snackbar snackbar) {
        // Snackbar shown
    }

    public void onSnackbarActionPressed(Snackbar snackbar) {
        // Snackbar action button pressed
    }

    public void onSnackbarSwiped(Snackbar snackbar) {
        // Snackbar dismissed via swipe
    }

    public void onSnackbarTimedOut(Snackbar snackbar) {
        // Snackbar dismissed via timeout (after duration passed)
    }

    public void onSnackbarManuallyDismissed(Snackbar snackbar) {
        // Snackbar dimissed via call to dismiss()
    }

    public void onSnackbarDismissedAfterAnotherShown(Snackbar snackbar) {
        // Snackbar dismissed because another Snackbar shown
    }
}
```

### ToastBuilder

Makes it very easy to create and customise `Toast` messages.

```java
new ToastBuilder(this)
    .message("message")
    .messageTextColor(Color.BLUE)
    .duration(Toast.LENGTH_LONG)
    .gravity(Gravity.TOP)
    .build()
    .show();
```

The builder allows you to change the text color of the displayed message. If you wish to change the background you can provide a custom view for the `Toast`. By providing the ID of a `TextView` within this view, you can set the message on it through the builder method `message(String)`.
